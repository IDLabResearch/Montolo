functionalProperties,Functional properties restriction type,Constraints of the constraint type functional properties state that object or data properties are functional within the context of a class.,https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
inverseFunctionalProperties,Inverse functional properties restriction type,Constraints of the constraint type inverse-functional properties state that object properties are inverse-functional within the context of a class.,https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
subsumption,Subsumption restriction type,The subsumption constraint type corresponds to concept inclusion in DL terminology. Subclass axioms are a fundamental type of axioms in OWL2 and can be used to construct class hierarchies.,https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
propertyDomains,Property domains restriction type,"Constraints of the property domains constraint type restrict the domain of object or data properties. In DL terminology, this constraint type is also called domain restrictions on roles. A constraint of the type property domains states that the domain of the object or data property p is the class C - that is, if an individual i is connected by p with some other individual or some literal, then i is an instance of C.",https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
propertyRanges,Property ranges restriction type,"Constraints of the constraint type property ranges restrict the range of object and data properties. In DL terminology, this constraint type is also called range restrictions on roles. The property ranges constraint type states that the range of the object or data property p is either (1) the class C - that is, if some individual is connected by p with an individual i, then i is an instance of C, or (2) the datatype DT - that is, if some individual is connected by p with a literal l, then l is in DT.",https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
literalPatternMatching,Literal pattern matching restriction type,Constraints of the constraint type literal pattern matching ensure that individuals of a given class C can only have relations via a specific data property p to literals of a specific datatype DT that match a certain literal pattern.,https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
literalRanges,Literal ranges restriction type,"Constraints of the constraint type literal ranges ensure that for individuals of class C, the literal values of the data property p of the datatype DT are within the literal range of [min, max].",https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
universalQuantification,Universal quantification restriction type,Universal quantifications (value restrictions in DL) are used to enforce that all individuals of a given class C are connected by particular properties p only to instances/literals of certain classes C or datatypes DT.,https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
minimumUnqualifiedCardinality,Minimum unqualified cardinality restriction type,"A constraint of the constraint type minimum unqualified cardinality restrictions consists of a non-negative integer n and an object or data property p, and it defines a class C which contains all those individuals that are connected by p to at least n different individuals/literals.

minimumQualifiedCardinality,Minimum qualified cardinality restriction type,"The constraint type minimum qualified cardinality restrictions consists of a non-negative integer n, an object or data property p, and a class C or a datatype DT, and it defines a class C_context which contains all those individuals that are connected by p to at least n different (1) individuals that are instances of C or (2) literals in DT.

Maximum unqualififed cardinality restrictions must hold for all instances of the class C_context.",https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
maximumQualifiedCardinality,Maximum qualified cardinality restriction type,"The constraint type maximum qualified cardinality restrictions consists of a non-negative integer n, an object or data proeprty p, and a class C or a atatype DT, and it defiens a class C_context which contains all those individuals that are connected by p to at most n different (1) individuals that are instances of C or (2) literals in DT. Maximum qualified cardinality restrictions must hold for all instances of the class C_context.",https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
exactUnqualifiedCardinality,Exact unqualified cardinality restriction type,"A constraint of the constraint type exact unqualified cardinality restrictions consists of a non-negative integer n and an object or data property p, and it defines a class C_context which contains all those individuals that are connected by p to exactly n different individuals/literals. Exact unqualified cardinality restrictions must hold for all instances of the class C_context.",https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
exactQualifiedCardinality,Exact qualified cardinality restriction type,"A constraint of the constriant type exact qualified cardinality restrictions consists of a non-negative integer n, an object or data property p, and a class C or a datatype DT, and it defines a class C_context which contains all those individuals that are connected by p to exactly n different (1) individuals that are instances of C or (2) literals in DT. Exact qualified cardinality restrictions must hold for all instances of the class C_context.",https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
asymmetricProperties,Asymmetric properties restriction type,"A property is asymmetric if it is disjoint from its own inverse. A constraint of the constraint type asymmetric object properties states that the object property p is asymmetric - that is, if an individual i_1 is connected by p to an individual i_2, then I_2 cannot be connected by p to i_2.",https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
irreflexiveProperties,Irreflexive properties restriction type,"A property is irreflexive if it is never locally reflexive. Constraints of the irreflexive object properties constraint type (irreflexive roles in DL) state that the object property p is irreflexive - that is, no individual is connected by p to itself.",https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000054062
